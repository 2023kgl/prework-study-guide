# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This webpage was designed for the purpose of learning the basics to coding, keeping all notes together, and to hopefully help others. 
It was build with the intent of helping keep track of the things I learned as I created this webpage. 
This serves as a guide for when a question comes up or for when I might need to recall useful information to use in any future projects. 
I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JAVA, and Git/GitHub.
